#Setting Up Your Git Environment

1) Save git-completion.bash file in your home directory as .git-completion.bash. The path to this file should now be (~/.git-completion.bash).

2) Save git-promt.bash file in your home directory as .git-prompt.bash. The path to this file should now be (~/.git-prompt.bash).

3)If you already have a file in your home directory named .bash_profile, copy the content from git_bash_profile and paste it at the bottom of .bash_profile. Otherwise, move git_bash_profile to your home directory and rename it to .bash_profile. If you use Linux, you may need to name this file .bashrc instead of .bash_profile.
